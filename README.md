This repo stores a small command line project that implements a sports competition scoreboard made in C++. 
I made this project as a way to practice Object Oriented Programming with one of the best languages there is
around to build quality desktop applications.

## What this application does
This application's purpose is to keep track of universities several teams and their scores among different sports 
in a competition and create an overall ranking of them to determine the winner of the competition.

## How to run it
This application is written in pure C++ and requires no external libraries. Compiling and running it should be as
simple as compiling main.cpp on your IDE of choice or running g++ -o main.exe main.cpp.

## A note on language
Being a personal project, the name of the variables, functions, classes, etc., in the code are written in Portuguese 
because it is my native tongue. One day maybe I will refactor this code to the english language.
